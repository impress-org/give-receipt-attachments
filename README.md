# GIVE RECEIPT ATTACHMENTS -- A Give Add-on
A [Give](https://givewp.com) Addon which allows you to add a file to any Give donation form and have it appear for your donors to download via the donation confirmation page and/or email donation receipt.

## FEATURES

* Choose custom title text for the confirmation page
* Choose custom link text for the attachment
* Upload your file via the Media Library Uploader
* Optionally set a minimum donation amount per form for the Attachment to be available to the donor.
* Add the link to your Admin notification email and/or the Donation receipt email via a custom Email tag.
* Forms that don't have uploads are not affected in any way.

## BASIC USAGE

At the bottom of each Give Form edit screen you'll find the Give Receipt Attachments settings area. You configure that per form. This includes the minimum donation amount necessary for the attachment to be available (optionally).

If you upload a file and configure the settings there, the attachment title and link will appear automatically before the Donation Receipt table on your Donation Confirmation page.

In order to have the attachment link appear in your donation receipt emails, go to "Donations > Settings" then the Emails tab. In the Donation Receipt email field add `{attachmenturl}` anywhere you like. Below that field you'll see a full list of all the available email tags.
