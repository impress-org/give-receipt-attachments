A Give Add-on which allows you to upload a file to use as an attachment on your donation email receipts and donation confirmation page.

== Description ==

A [Give](https://givewp.com) Addon which allows you to add a file to any Give donation form and have it appear for your donors to download via the donation confirmation page and email confirmation.

This has many potential use-cases. Here's a few ideas:

* 

## Features

* Choose custom title text for the confirmation page
* Choose custom link text for the download
* Upload your file via the Media Library Uploader
* Optionally set a minimum donation amount per form for the Gift to be available to the donor.
* Add the link to your Admin notification email and/or the Donor notification email via a custom Email tag.
* Forms that don't have uploads are not affected in any way.

## About Matt Cromwell

I'm Head of Support and Community Outreach at [WordImpress](https://wordimpress.com). Our most popular plugin is [Give](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give), the leading donation plugin for WordPress. I build custom WordPress plugins and themes and blog frequently at [mattcromwell.com](https://www.mattcromwell.com) on WordPress, Religion and Politics, and Family life. 

If you are enjoying [Give Receipt Attachments](https://www.mattcromwell.com/products/give-receipt-attachments) please consider giving a donation to support my free plugin and theme development. All donations provided through my website go to help San Diego nonprofit organizations with their hosting and web maintenance.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0.15 or greater
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To install Give Receipt Attachments, login to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Give Receipt Attachments" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, ratings and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site before doing any plugin or theme updates just in case. If you have any trouble with an update, try out our [WP-Rollback plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rollback) which lets you revert to previous versions of WordPress plugins or themes with just a couple clicks.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
